Task Name: Optimization Model for Solving a Business Problem

Objectives:
Problem Identification: Choose a relevant business problem that can be solved using optimization techniques (e.g., maximizing profit, minimizing cost, resource allocation).
Modeling: Formulate the business problem into a linear programming model.
Solution: Use Python libraries like PuLP to solve the optimization problem.
Insights: Analyze and interpret the results, providing actionable insights for the business.
Key Points:
Optimization Techniques: Linear programming or other optimization methods to find the best solution.
Python Libraries: PuLP to model and solve the optimization problem.
Deliverable: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the problem setup, solution, and business insights derived from the optimization results.
Techniques Used:
Linear Programming: Formulating business constraints and objectives into mathematical equations.
Python Libraries: PuLP for solving linear programming problems.
Problem Setup: Clearly defining decision variables, constraints, and the objective function.
Solution: Using PuLP to find the optimal solution and interpret it.
